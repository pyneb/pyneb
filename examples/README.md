This is a description of the included examples.

The six-camelback example includes the least action path (LAP) with the nudged
elastic band (NEB) and dynamic programming methods
The Muller-Brown example includes both the LAP and the minimum energy path (MEP) using NEB
The LEPs example includes the LAP and MEP using NEB, as well as the LAP using Dijkstra's algorithm
