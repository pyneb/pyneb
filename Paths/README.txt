Conventions:

-Save all paths as comma-separated values, with appropriate column heads (q20/q30/pairing)
-Save separate nuclei in different folders
-Only save one path plot. When you add a path to the directory, update the plot with all of the
    paths that are present. Label the key according to the path file it's pulled from.
-For 3D PESs, project down onto normal pairing/etc
-Add an explanatory file with the following:
    -Who made the path
    -When the path was made
    -What method was used (NEB/dynamic programming/Euler-Lagrange)
    -Any other parameters necessary to fully describe the method
    -Final action value
    -Run time
-Remove files when you update them
