Conventions:

-Save all paths as comma-separated values, with appropriate column heads (q20/q30/pairing)
-Save separate nuclei in different folders
-Add paths to a plot of the PES. For 3D PESs, project down onto normal pairing/etc
-Add an explanatory file when appropriate
-Remove files when you update them (no need for 32 versions of Eric's path)
